This folder holds definitions to build an NGINX server that will produce SYSLOG to be consumed by the ELK stack. 
This is for testing purposes only. 
Note that the ELK stack is configured to filter for IOS-XR syslog messages and will not accept the NGINX messages be default.
Grok filters for NGINX can be found online.
